# azuran
azuran is just a wrapper around g++

# Why summon the azuran?

Because `g++` by default, bestow us with warnings and what not that spans a thousand and one shell screens for even something as little as a syntax error. Azuran returns only the fatal errors, saving your time and eyes.

# Installation

If you have rust installed, simply clone and run:

`cargo build`

Or you can get the compiled package from the [Releases](https://github.com/officialcjunior/azuran/releases/) page.
